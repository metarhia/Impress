[Impress](https://github.com/metarhia/Impress) Application Server for
[node.js](http://nodejs.org). All decisions are made. Solutions are scaled.
Tools are provided and optimized for high load. Ready for applied development
and production.

Impress (Impress Application Server, IAS) follows alternative way in several
aspects:
  - No callback chain (no middleware);
  - Monolithic high-coupling core with obligatory things optimized for
  performance;
  - Extensible plug-ins format for optionally needed things;
  - Applied code simplicity, API code high-level abstraction and brevity;
  - Support for both Stateful and Stateless approach;
  - Application can't include Application Server, quite the opposite,
  Application Server is a container for Applications;
  - No I/O is faster even then async I/O, so maximum memory usage and lazy I/O
  is the choice;

## Features

  - Can serve multiple applications and sites on multiple domains
  - Serves multiple ports, network interfaces, hosts and protocols
  - Can scale on multiple servers
  - Supports application sandboxing (configuration, db and memory access isolation)
  - Utilize multiple CPU cores with instances/workers
    - Cross-process communication (not using built-in node.js cluster library)
    - State synchronization mechanism with transactions and subscription
  - No need to write routing manually in code, just create handler files and functions
  - File system watching for cache reloading when file changes on disk
  - Caching server-side executable JavaScript in memory
  - Handlers inheritance override hierarchically
  - API development support (simple way for JSON-based WEB-services development)
    - RPC-style API (Stateful, state stored in memory between requests)
    - REST-style API (Stateless, each call is separate, no state in memory)
    - Implements JSTP (long live and full duplex RPC/MQ over TCP or websockets)
  - Multiple handlers for HTTP API (all handlers are optional and
  inheritable/overridable): `access.js` returns access modifiers; `request.js`
  executing for all requests (any HTTP verbs and before verb handler); HTTP
  verbs: `get.js`, `post.js`, etc. executes for certain HTTP verb,;`end.js`
  executes after HTTP verb handler for all verbs; `lazy.js` lazy handler executes
  after the request has already returned to the client-side; `error.js` executed
  only if an error occurred while processing the request or in any previous
  handler
  - Supported multiple AJAX API result types: JSON for most APIs (including safe
  serialization); JSONP (for cross-domain requests); CSV; HTML (aor any extension
  unknown for IAS) for AJAX server-side HTML rendering; JSTP (for JavaScript
  Transfer Protocol)
  - Server server-side simple templating with caching, data structures iterators
  and personalization based on user groups
  - Serving static files with in-memory preprocessing: gzipping and HTTP
  `if-modified-since` support with HTTP 304 "Not Modified" answer; memory caching
  and file system watching for cache reloading when files changed on disk;
  JavaScript minification with `uglify-js`; SASS compiling styles from `.scss` to
  `.css` in memory cache
  - Built-in sessions support with authentication, groups and anonymous sessions
  - Multiple protocols support:
    - JSTP (JavaScript Transfer Protocol) for RPC and MQ
    (https://github.com/metarhia/JSTP)
    - HTTP and HTTPS (node native libraries)
    - Implemented SSE (Server-Sent Events) with channels and multi-cast
    - WebSockets support (even on shared host/port with other handlers, using
    regular connection upgrade)
    - TCP and UDP sockets support
  - Reverse-proxy (routing request to external HTTP server with URL-rewriting)
  - Server-wide or application-specific logging, with log buffering (lazy write)
  and rotation (keep logs N days)
  - Connection drivers for database engines: MongoDB, PgSQL, MySQL (based on
  `felixge/mysql` and `musql-utilities`), Memcached, Relational schema generator
  from JSON database schemas
  - File utilities: upload, download, streaming
  - GeoIP support, based on `geoip-lite` module (uses MaxMind database)
  - Sending emails using `nodemailer`
  - Social networking login using `Passport.js`
  - Built-in simple testing framework
  - Server health monitoring
  - Built-in data structures validation and preprocessing library
  - Process forking:
    - Long workers with `client` object forwarding to separate process
    - Task scheduling (interval or certain time)
  - V8 features support:
    - Long stack trace with --stack-trace-limit=1000 and stack output minification
    - Wrapper for V8 internal functions with --allow-natives-syntax
    - Manual garbage collection with --nouse-idle-notification --expose-gc
  - HTTP base authentication implemented (optional omitting local requests)

## Examples

Example #1  
To create GET request handler for URL `/api/method.json`  
File `/api/method.json/get.js`
```javascript
module.exports = function(client, callback) {
  callback({ field: 'value' });
};
```
Result: `{ "field": "value" }`

Handler also may look like (ES6 should be supported by node.js version):
```javascript
(client, callback) => {
  callback({ field: 'value' });
}
```

Example #2  
To create POST request handler for URL `/api/method.json`  
File `/api/method.json/post.js`
```javascript
module.exports = function(client, callback) {
  dbImpress.users.find({ group: client.fields.group }).toArray(function(err, nodes) {
    callback(nodes);
  });
};
```
Result:
```javascript
[
  { "login": "Vasia Pupkin", "password": "whoami", "group": "users" },
  { "login": "Marcus Aurelius", "password": "tomyself", "group": "users" }
]
```

Example #3  
File `access.js` works similar to `.htaccess` and allow one to define access rules for each folder, by simply putting `access.js` in it.  
If folder does not contain `access.js` it inherits access rules from its parent folder, all the way up to the project root.

Example:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  guests:  true,  // Allow requests from anonimous users (not logged or no session)
  logged:  true,  // Allow requests from logged users
  http:    true,  // Allow requests using http protocol
  https:   true,  // Allow requests using https protocol
  groups:  [],    // Allow access for user groups listed in array
                  //   or for all if array is empty or no groups specified
  intro:   true,  // Generate introspection for API methods in this directory
  index:   false, // Generate directory index
  virtual: true   // Allow requests to virtual paths, for CMS, REST URLs, etc.
}
```

## Installation and upgrade

- Install to the current folder: `npm install impress`
- Install using package.json: add to `dependencies` and run `npm install`
- Installation scripts for an empty server (from the scratch)
  - For CentOS 6 `/deploy/centos6x32.sh` and `centos6x64.sh`
  (tested on CentOS 6.6 32/64bit minimal)
  - For CentOS 7 `/deploy/centos7x64.sh`
  (tested on CentOS 7.0 with systemd 64bit minimal)
  - For Ubuntu 14 and 15 `/deploy/ubuntu.sh`
  (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit minimal)
  - For Debian 7 and 8 `/deploy/debian.sh`
  (tested for Debian 7.5 64bit minimal)
  - For Fedora 22, 23 and 24 for x64 `/deploy/fedora.sh`
  
You can prepare scripts based on examples above and run at a target server shell:
`curl http://.../install.sh | sh` or `wget http://.../install.sh -O - | sh`

If Impress Application Server is already installed in directory you want to
install/update it using npm, `/applications` directory contains applications
and `/config` contains configuration, Impress will safely detect previous
installation and update libraries and dependencies.

## Impress CLI commands

You can use following commands from any directory:
  - `impress path <path>` to display or change path to IAS
  - `impress start` to start IAS server
  - `impress stop` to stop IAS server
  - `impress restart` to restart IAS server
  - `impress status` to display IAS status
  - `impress update` to update IAS version
  - `impress autostart [on|off]` to add/remove IAS to autostart on system reboot
  - `impress list` to see IAS applications list
  - `impress add [path]` to add application
  - `impress remove [name]` to remove application
  - `impress new [name]` to create application

## Configuration

1. Install Impress as described above
2. Edit `/config/*.js` to configure Application Server
(set IP address in servers.js)
3. After installation you have `example` application in directory
`/applications`, you can rename it and/or place there other applications
4. Edit `/applications/example/config/hosts.js`, change `127.0.0.1` to
`myapp.com`, certainly you need to register and configure domain name myapp.com
or just add it into `hosts` file in your OS
5. Place your html to `/applications/example/app/html.template` and copy
required files into directories `/static/js`, `/static/css`, `/static/images`
and start application API development
6. Run Impress using command `service impress start` or `systemctl start impress`
(if installed as a service) or `node server.js`
